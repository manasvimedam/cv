  <h1>-Hi, I'm Manasvi.</h1>
  <p> <em>software engineer, novice artist, and student at Rutgers University-New Brunswick.</em></p>

  <br>
  <p>Hey there! I'm a second-year student at Rutgers University-New Brunswick from Princeton, New Jersey (Central Jersey exists!), majoring in Computer Science and minoring in business administration.

    My introduction to computer science was in my 8th-grade computer programming class. I still vividly remember how I sat in front of my computer for hours trying to get the little turtle in Terrapin Logo to write "Hello World". It did not take me
    long to learn to love the frustration and fulfillment that came with programming. I became obsessed with coding for anything and anyone. My passion lies in finding a way to use programming to solve any and every problem. Outside of Computer
    Science and Finance, you can find me working with a fantastic group of people to empower women in STEM and leadership roles through Rutgers <a href="https://rutgerswics.org/">WiCS (Women in Computer Science) events director</a>, <a
      href="https://ruhackhers.org/">HackHers finance director</a>, mentoring underclassmen, helping others learn data structures as a
    teaching assistant, drawing my favorite musicians, actors, and actresses, getting bubble tea, or learning Korean.

    Talk to me about your creative side hustles, favorite tunes, movies, tv shows, or foods!</p>
